    <p>My name is Mikaela.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm a lover of the Front-End, and learning how to tackle scaleable and
      reusable design.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      With background in International Relations and Global Studies, I've an
      interest in understanding people--their needs, perspectives, and
      stories--and in challenging my understanding of the world.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As an artist, I'm addicted to detail. My mission is to create those little
      experiences that make all the difference.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When I need a break, you can catch me on the trail, disconnecting and
      reconnecting with the world ~
