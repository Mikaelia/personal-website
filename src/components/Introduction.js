    <p>My name is Mikaela.</p>

      I'm a Software Engineer and Front-End fan. I love learning to tackle
      scaleable and reusable design.

    <br />
    <p>
      With background in International Relations/Global Studies, I've an
      interest in understanding people--their needs, thoughts, and stories--and
      the world.

    <p>
      As an artist, I'm am addicted to detail. My mission: to create those
      little experiences that make all the difference. I'm constantly reading,
      looking for ways to improve, and wishing there was just a little bit more
      time in the day.

      When I need a break, you can catch me on the trail, disconnecting and
      reconnecting with the world
