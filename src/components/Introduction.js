    <p>My name is Mikaela.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm a Front-End engineer who loves learning how to tackle scaleable and
      reusable design.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      With a background in International Relations and Global Studies, I'm
      driven to understand people, and unearth perspectives that challenge my
      own.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Now immersed in the world of tech, I'm still chipping away at an
      ever-growing mountain of whys. I'm constantly seeking to improve,
      innovate, and learn from those around me.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As an artist, I'm addicted to detail. My mission is to create virtual
      experiences that'll brighten your day.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When I need a break, you can catch me on the trail, disconnecting and
      reconnecting with the world. ~ â˜¼
